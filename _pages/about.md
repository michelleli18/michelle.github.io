Caltech Computing + Mathematical Sciences. </br>
Class of 2025.

Hola! My name is Michelle and I'm a senior at Caltech studying Computer Science and Information and Data Science. I love tackling complex, unanswered problems (many with data constraints) that require unique innovations to work through. Specifically, I strive to find those related to helping others and our communities.  

At school, I am in the [Yue Lab](http://www.yisongyue.com/group.php) with [Prof. Yisong Yue](http://www.yisongyue.com/index.php) for neuroscience + AI projects and frequently collaborate with [Prof. Katie Bouman's](http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~klbouman/) [Computational Cameras Lab](https://computationalcameras.org/) as well. I continue to be inspired every day by both my PIs and their labs, their dedication, attention to rigor, and curiosity to explore the unknown heavily influences my research outlook. My current research involves <b>decoding brain signals</b> and <b>diffusion models for inverse problems</b>. As mentioned, the specific format of the data varies (images, time series, neuron spikes, etc) but most projects deal with a significant lack of data. I enjoy thinking critically about how to extract the most information out of our data for . I am honored ot be supported by the [Mellon Mays Undergraduate Fellowship](https://www.mellon.org/mmuf).

Over the summers, I enjoy venturing out into industry to see what's up. I've had the honor to work with the [NVIDIA Autonomous Vehicles Safety Team](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/self-driving-cars/), [Uber AI Michelangelo Team](https://www.uber.com/blog/michelangelo-machine-learning-platform/) and [Uber Spark Team](https://www.uber.com/blog/uscs-apache-spark/) (in order of recency).

In my free time, I enjoy reading, taking photos, running, and playing the guzheng :D
