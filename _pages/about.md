Hi! My name is Michelle and I'm a senior at Caltech studying Computer Science and Information and Data Science. At its core, I enjoy tackling unsolved problems (most likely due to data constraints) that require unique innovations to work through. I strive to find those related to helping others and our communities. 

At school, I am in the [Yue Lab](http://www.yisongyue.com/group.php) with [Prof. Yisong Yue](http://www.yisongyue.com/index.php) for neuroscience + AI projects and frequently collaborate with [Prof. Katie Bouman](http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~klbouman/)'s [Computational Cameras Lab](https://computationalcameras.org/) as well. Over the summers, I enjoy venturing out into industry to see what's up. Please see projects for a basic description of my work with the [Uber AI Michelangelo Team] and NVIDIA Autonomous Vehicle Safety Team.

In my free time, I enjoy reading, photography, running, and playing a tradional instrument called the guzheng :D
